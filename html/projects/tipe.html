            <p>
                TIPE is one of the many exam you have to pass when you are in what we call in France: "Classe
                Préparatoire aux Grandes Ecoles" (CPGE). It is a little research project that consists of studying a
                scientific topic and present the results during a short presentation.

                Originaly I wanted to work on <a href="https://www.seagate.com/fr/fr/innovation/hamr/"
                    target="_blank">Heat Assisted Magnetic Recoarding</a> (HAMR), a technology introduced by Seagate in
                order to improve HDD's data density. But, being a proprietary technology, only few informations were
                public and I ultimately had to abandon this topic...

                At that time, nuclear fusion was a very intersting subject because it looked like the perfect solution
                regarding energy supply but it was also very challenging. The concept is simple: instead of breaking
                atoms
                like we do in nuclear fission we force particles to merge creating a huge amount of energy.

                But there is a catch: the reaction can only be made at very high temperature. So hot that nothing can
                touch it! In the vast majority of articles there is a sentence like: "Scientists are recreating the sun
                on Earth" or "Scientists are controling the power of the sun".

                There are many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtMbur2RQyXREELudU3vHFtoD9mccnvOi"
