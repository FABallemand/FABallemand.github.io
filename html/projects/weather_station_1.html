            <h2>Living in Strasbourg</h2>
            <p>
                I used to live in the south of France only one hour away from the closest beach where you can expect to
                enjoy the warmth of the sun even in the middle of winter. Then I had to move to
                Strasbourg...
            </p>
            <p>
                Strasbourg is a really nice city with a very interesting background, a unique local culture and a lot of
                delicious meals. The only issue being the weather which is notably cold and humid with a noticeable lack
                of sun.
            </p>
            <p>
                One morning while walking in the fog to my school I felt the unpleasant sensation of condensation on my
                moustache and I wondered how cold and humid it was. I immediately wanted to build some sort of weather
                station to monitor temperature and humidity!

            <h2>
                Learning Arduino Basics
            </h2>
            <p>
                I thought it was a great opportunity to finally use some <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduinos</a>.
                <br>
                After some online research I bought a couple of Arduino boards and a bunch of modules to play with:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    AHT-10 Temperature and humidity sensor
                </li>
                <li>
                    HW-111 Real time clock
                </li>
                <li>
                    FS1000A/MX-RM-5V aka the cheapest 433MHz wireless emitter/receiver combo
                </li>
                <li>
                    16x2 LCD Display
                </li>
            </ul>
            The initial goal was to make a little device that can display the current date and time as well as the
            temperature and humidity inside and outside. I grabbed a breadboard and started prototyping!
            </p>
            <img src="../../ressource/img/projects/weather_station_1/1.jpg" alt="Picture of the breadboard."
                title="Final prototype." width="480" height="270">
            <p>
                After a healthy amount of trial-and-error and debugging I obtained this little plate of spaghetti. But
                it worked!
            </p>
            <p>
                After more reflexion I decided to replace the two potentiometers that allow to adjust the display's
                luminosity for a Light Dynamic Resistor (LDR) which will allow me to adjust the brightness of the screen
                through software according to the room luminosity.
            </p>
            <p>
                After further investigation, the wireless modules that I used are not very good. They require an
                additional antena otherwise they only work if they are half a breadboard away from each other. Moreover,
                having a module mesuroing temperature outside means battery, a subject that I did not had time to tackle
                just yet. So I momentarily abandonned the outside probe.

            <h2>
                Custom PCB
            </h2>
            <p>
                As I wanted to create a very basic device (with a basic rectangle enclosure) I simply made a rectangle
                PCB with reasonable dimensions using <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="warning">Be careful while designing your PCB! You have to take into account on which face you want
                to place each component otherwise you might not be able to solder it...
            </p>
            <p>
                The next step was obviously to go to <a href="http://fablab.telecom-ps.unistra.fr/doku.php"
                    target="_blank">Télécom Physique Strasbourg's FabLab</a> and make the PCB using the <a
                    href="https://www.lpkfusa.com/products/pcb_prototyping/machines/protomat_s64/"
                    target="_blank">Protomat-S64</a>.
                <br>
                After a bit of (bad) soldering work and repair (because I burned a trace while unsoldering the 16 pin
                LCD) I obtained this beautiful weather station.

                3D-printed Enclosure
            </h2>
            <p>
                Obviously if I want to use it I have to put it into some sort of enclosure not only to protect it but
                also to make it stand up. As I was a 3D-printing novice I settled for a very simple design with no back
                panel and three holes to accomodate the screen, the LDR and the Arduino's USB port.
                <br>
                As you can see on the picture underneath the first print turned out perfect on apparence. But in fact
                the walls are a little to flexible and looking at it closely you will notice that the hole for the LDR
                is not where it should be... oups 🤭

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            [Picture of the final assembly coming soon]
            <p>
                With a little time and effort I managed to create a simple weather station based on Arduino. It is able
                to keep track of time and measure both temperature and humidity. These three informations are easily
                readable on a LCD screen which brightness adapt in function of the ambiant luminosity. All the
                electronic modules are connected via a custom PCB and secured in a 3D-printed enclosure.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this first version allowed me to learn the basics it could also be improved. I already have some
                ideas regarding other captors, buttons to navigate in the UI, wireless transmission and batteries.
