            <h2>Living in Strasbourg</h2>
            <p>
                I used to live in the south of France only one hour away from the closest beach where you can expect to
                enjoy the warmth of the sun even in the middle of winter. Then I had to move to
                Strasbourg...
            </p>
            <p>
                Strasbourg is a really nice city with a very interesting background, a unique local culture and a lot of
                delicious meals. The only issue being the weather which is notably cold and humid with a noticeable lack
                of sun.
            </p>
            <p>
                One morning while walking in the fog to my school I felt the unpleasant sensation of condensation on my
                moustache and I wondered how cold and humid it was. I immediately wanted to build some sort of weather
                station to monitor temperature and humidity!

            <h2>
                Learning Arduino Basics
            </h2>
            <p>
                I thought it was a great opportunity to finally use some <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">Arduinos</a>.
                <br>
                After some online research I bought a couple of Arduino boards and a bunch of modules to play with:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    AHT-10 Temperature and humidity sensor
                </li>
                <li>
                    HW-111 Real time clock
                </li>
                <li>
                    FS1000A/MX-RM-5V aka the cheapest 433MHz wireless emitter/receiver combo
                </li>
                <li>
                    16x2 LCD Display
                </li>
            </ul>
            The initial goal was to make a little device that can display the current date and time as well as the
            temperature and humidity inside and outside. I grabbed a breadboard and started prototyping!
            </p>
            <img src="../../ressource/img/projects/weather_station_1/1.jpg" alt="Picture of the breadboard."
                title="Final prototype." width="480" height="270">
            <p>
                After a healthy amount of trial-and-error and debugging I obtained this little plate of spaghetti. But
                it worked!
            </p>
            <p>
                After more reflexion I decided to replace the two potentiometers that allow to adjust the display's luminosity for a Light Dynamic Resistor (LDR) which will allow me to adjust the brightness of the screen through software according to the room luminosity.
            </p>
            <p>
                After further investigation, the wireless modules that I used are not very good. They require an additional antena otherwise they only work if they are half a breadboard away from each other. Moreover, having a module mesuroing temperature outside means battery, a subject that I did not had time to tackle just yet. So I momentarily abandonned the outside probe.

            <h2>
                Custom PCB
            </h2>
            <p>
                As I wanted to create a very basic device (with a basic rectangle enclosure) I simply made a rectangle
                PCB with reasonable dimensions using <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="warning">Be careful while designing your PCB! You have to take into account on which face you want
                to place each component otherwise you might not be able to solder it...
            </p>
            <p>
                The next step was obviously to go to <a href="http://fablab.telecom-ps.unistra.fr/doku.php" target="_blank">Télécom Physique Strasbourg's FabLab</a> and make the PCB using the <a href="https://www.lpkfusa.com/products/pcb_prototyping/machines/protomat_s64/" target="_blank">Protomat-S64</a>.
                <br>
                After a bit of (bad) soldering work and repair (because I burned a trace while unsoldering the 16 pin LCD) I obtained this beautiful weather station.
