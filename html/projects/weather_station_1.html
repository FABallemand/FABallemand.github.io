            <h2>Living in Strasbourg</h2>
            <p>
                I used to live in the south of France only one hour away from the closest beach where you can expect to
                enjoy the warmth of the sun even in the middle of winter. Then I had to move to
                Strasbourg...
            </p>
            <p>
                Strasbourg is a really nice city with a very interesting background, a unique local culture and a lot of delicious meals. The only issue being the weather which is notably cold and humid with a noticeable lack of sun.
            </p>
            <p>
                One morning while walking in the fog to my school I felt the unpleasant sensation of condensation on my moustache and I wondered how cold and humid it was. I immediately wanted to build some sort of weather station to monitor temperature and humidity!
