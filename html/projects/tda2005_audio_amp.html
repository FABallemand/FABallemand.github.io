                <!-- I was (and I am still) very impressed by the DIY bluetooth speaker made by <a href="https://diyperks.com/" target="_blank">DIYPerks</a> and I always wanted to do something similar.  -->
                I had already made/improved a little portable speaker by reusing the circuit board of an old cheap
                speaker, pairing it with a better speaker and putting it in a "stylish" (but impractical) wooden case.
            </p>
            <p>
                But having learnt how to create my own PCBs (with Iron Peroxyde III) I wanted to create my very own
                speakers to use on my desk. Let me clarify: I wanted a set of speakers that I could use both via cable
                with my computer and via bluetooth with my phone. The final speaker was supposed to seat on my desk,
                serving as a screen stand for my main monitor.

                I already had a pair of old JBL mid-range speakers and I found a <a

                    target="_blank">TDA-2005</a> in my garage. All was left to do was to mount everything together!!

                I was really pleased when I saw there were already a couple examples in the <a
                    href="https://www.alldatasheet.fr/datasheet-pdf/pdf/25037/STMICROELECTRONICS/TDA2005.html"
                    target="_blank">TDA-2005</a> datasheet showing different ways to use it. I settled for a basic
                circuit using a single IC to drive two speakers.

            <p>
                I designed the circuit using <a href="https://www.kicad.org/" target="_blank">KiCad</a> and made the
                first board. After testing: it did not work. So I made another one with a couple changes: same result.
                For my defense I was stuck with single face PCB so the wiring was not easy and certainly not ideal.
                Unfortunatly, the project momentarily stopped...

                Until I learnt how to use the <a
                    href="https://www.lpkf.com/en/industries-technologies/research-in-house-pcb-prototyping/produkte/lpkf-protomat-s64"
                    target="_blank">Protomat S64</a> that was available at my new school's <a
                    href="http://fablab.telecom-ps.unistra.fr/doku.php" target="_blank">FabLab</a>. I did not want to
                rush things again so I wanted to test the circuit on breadboards. Due to the pin layout of the amplifier
                IC I had to create a custom PCB to test everything.
