            <h2>
                A Broken Stool
            </h2>
            <p>
                My parents finally bought some new stools that are actually able to support my weight!! ðŸ˜… With a metal
                structure and a dark wooden-like top they look great... but there is an issue. One of them came with a
                missing foot making it wobbly and increasing the risk of scratching the floor.
                <!-- Even though it's not the end of the world (we could use the stool as is) it is less than optimal: the stool is a little bit wobbly  -->
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- My dad immediatly started thinking about a DIY solution involving PVC tubes and tape...not ideal. -->
                So I came to the rescue and proposed to create a replacing part thanks to 3D Scanning and 3D-printing.
            </p>

            <h2>
                3D Scan
            </h2>
            <p>
                Knowing there was a 3D Scanner that I had never used at my school's FabLab, the initial goal was to 3D
                Scan
                one of the other feet and 3D-print it.
            </p>
            <figure class="content-pic-figure">
                <img src="../../ressource/img/projects/stool/5.jpg" alt="EinScan-S" title="EinScan-S" width="480"
                    height="270">
            </figure>
            <p>
                The scanner is an EinScan-S and is made of two parts: the camera/lightning module and the rotating
                plate. It works
                by taking multiple pictures of the object under different position and
                lightning conditions.
            </p>
            <figure class="content-pic-figure">
                <iframe width="480" height="270"
                    src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaprXpPyIBw&list=PLsWB3eUdhgEsBo4EwQv8pe8QFDXdSjVxI&index=8&ab_channel=3DTARGETautoplay=0&mute=1">
                </iframe>
            </figure>
            <p>
                With some trial and error (and a little bit of assistance from a FabLab Manager) I managed to make the
                3D
                scanner work.
                <br>
                Beware that there is a dedicated on/off switch for the light porjector. ðŸ˜… Other than that the process
                is
                rather straight forward. You follow the calibration protocol described in the software then
                you place the object you want to scan on the rotating plate and just like that you can start scanning.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, this particular scanner is not very precise and is not recommanded for objects that are
                dark,
                concave and smaller than 30x30x30 mm... Which happens to be exactly what I had. ðŸ«  Not being a Blender
                wizard I didn't manage to transform the scan result into a beautiful model ready to be printed.

                3D Design
            </h2>
            <p>
                Back to the drawing board! I fired up my trusty Fusion 360 and started designing a proper model. And
                within
                a few clicks I obtained this:

                <image></image>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Much better! Let's print it!

            <h2>
                3D Print
            </h2>
            <p>
                As the feet of the stool need to be able to sustain a lot of stress (due to the weight they will have to
                support or the shocks when the stool is moved around) I had to avoid fragile materials. Fortunately, I
                found
                a spool of <a href="https://zortrax.com/filaments/z-semiflex/" target="_blank">Z-SEMIFLEX</a> which is
                both
                resistant and flexible.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a few hours of work on a <a href="https://zortrax.com/3d-printers/m200-plus/"
                    target="_blank">Zortrax
                    M22 Plus</a> I obtained four feet that look similar to the original one.

                But do they fit??
