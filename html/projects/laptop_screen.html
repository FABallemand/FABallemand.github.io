                A Broken Laptop
            </h2>
            <p>
                My brother's laptop stopped working. After <a href="#">trying to fix it</a>, I decided to reuse every working component. I started with the <a href="#">webcam</a> then I wanted to use the screen.

            </h2>
            <p>
                The laptop was a 15.6" HP laptop. By disassembling it I was able to access the screen but laptop screens are technically just the bare panel so they have a proprietary connector and surely does not understand basic HDMI or VGA signals. But by searching for the reference of the panel on the internet you might be able to find control boards for the screen. I found mine on eBay for less than 25€ with support for both HDMI and VGA.

            <p>
                The control board requires a 12V power supply. I found an old 12V power brick in my garage, cut the proprietary connector and soldered a brand new barrel plug fitting the one on the board.

                Some Woodwork
            </h2>
            <p>
                After some preliminary testing everything seemed to work fine. However, in order to use the screen, I had to mount it and its new control board on some sort of support. I opted for a simple piece of wood with the panel glued on one side and the control board screwed on the other. To improve usability I haded a kick stand. It originally was supposed to be horizontal but due to space constrains I had to make it vertical which make it fairly impractical. Eventhough the hinge is quite strong, the kick stand (also made of wood) has the tendency to slide on most desk surface.

                I tried my best to make the whole assembly compact and visualy interesting by rounding the edges and applying some wood glaze.

                Conclusion

            <p>
                This project was very interesting because on top of creating a little screen that I can actually carry around and use with my laptop, it also allowed me to reuse an old (and free) working component that would otherwise have ended in a landfill.

        <section id="script" class="hiden">
            Would you believe me if I told you you should not trhow away your old (maybe broken) laptop because it could
            become your next favorite piece of equipement?

            While most users see laptop as a unique device, I prefer to see it as the assembly of multiple smaller
            independant parts: a motherboard, a keyboard, a webcam, a screen...
            So when I failed to repair my brother's laptop motherboard I immediately scavanged all the parts I could reuse.
            Eventhough the screen looks very promising at first glance it is not the easiest part to refurbish as laptop screens are bare LCD panels with proprietary connectors and no control board to handle external signals like HDMI.
            Fortunatly there are a lot of control boards available online and with a bit of research I found one matching the LCD panel I had.

            With the control board received I connected the board to the screen and performed a test. Everything worked perfectly fine so it was time to build a stand to make that screen useable.

            For that I simply used a thin piece of wood that I cut and drilled so the screen could be glued on the front and the cables routed toward the back. By using some standoffs I mounted the control board on the other side and added another small piece of wood on top of it to protect it while leaving all the ports accessible. A small hinge screwed to the last wooden piece made a perfect support for the screen to stay upright.
            With a few more finishing touches like rounding the edges with a wood rasp and sand paper, adding a coat of wood stain and managing the control board's cables the screen was complete!!

            The final product is surprisingly usable. The control board support HDMI, VGA, DVI as well as audio. There are a couple of buttons to navigate into the basic but fonctional UI.
            Being made out of wood, the stand is a little bit on the heavy side but very resistant and compact making it very portable as long as you are careful not to scratch the screen. Eventhough the stand is not rising the screen, the hinge on the back allows for a wide range of tilt so the screen could be used like a real laptop screen.
            As all the materials were reused, the entiere cost of the project is reduced to the price of the control board which was about 20 euros. Not to expensive for creating a DIY computer screen and saving a perfectly working LCD panel from the landfill...
