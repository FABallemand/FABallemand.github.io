                A Broken Laptop
            </h2>
            <p>
                My brother's laptop stopped working. After <a href="#">trying to fix it</a>, I decided to reuse every working component. I started with the <a href="#">webcam</a> then I wanted to use the screen.

            </h2>
            <p>
                The laptop was a 15.6" HP laptop. By disassembling it I was able to access the screen but laptop screens are technically just the bare panel so they have a proprietary connector and surely does not understand basic HDMI or VGA signals. But by searching for the reference of the panel on the internet you might be able to find control boards for the screen. I found mine on eBay for less than 25€ with support for both HDMI and VGA.

                Power Supply
            </h2>
            <p>
                The control board requires a 12V power supply. I found an old 12V power brick in my garage, cut the proprietary connector and soldered a brand new barrel plug fitting the one on the board.

                Some Woodwork
            </h2>
            <p>
                After some preliminary testing everything seemed to work fine. However, in order to use the screen, I had to mount it and its new control board on some sort of support. I opted for a simple piece of wood with the panel glued on one side and the control board screwed on the other. To improve usability I haded a kick stand. It originally was supposed to be horizontal but due to space constrains I had to make it vertical which make it fairly impractical. Eventhough the hinge is quite strong, the kick stand (also made of wood) has the tendency to slide on most desk surface.

                I tried my best to make the whole assembly compact and visualy interesting by rounding the edges and applying some wood glaze.

                Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p>
                This project was very interesting because on top of creating a little screen that I can actually carry around and use with my laptop, it also allowed me to reuse an old (and free) working component that would otherwise have ended in a landfill.

            Would you believe me if I told you you should not trhow away your old (maybe broken) laptop because it could
            become your next favorite piece of equipement? Or at least part of it...
            While most users see laptop as a unique device, I prefer to see it as the assembly of multiple smaller
            independant parts.
            So when my brother's laptop had a motherboard issue the first thing I saw was a perfectly good screen.
